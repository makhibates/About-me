<p></p>There is a lot of controversy of race and racism. There is lots of confusion about how racism works and how it is used. I don't have a big opinion or enough info about it.

<p></p>I think this quote is very important because we need to be more aware. There are alot of war going on right now and lots of distractions to come with. We keep trying to come together but some other distraction come in front.

<p></p>I think this quote ties in to the brainwash quote as well. This means that if u only know this bad attitude than you know no better. You need to follow the good path or the bad will consume you.

<p></p>This quote to me is a big rule in my life. I Said that i have to love myself first before anyone else, this is how we are able to respect and love anyone else. We can also give out good energy if we love ourselves.

<p></p>I think this topic means to take a step back and realize how everything is to benefit the white man. They have covered the black history so we won't come together. They want us not to be together.

<p></p>This quote means that in our history that we have been getting brainwashed to not feel powerful. It makes us go against each other to seperate us. We try to get back together  but they keep holding back.

<p></p>Defeating odds as black men is a very important thing to do. It helps that one person and the rest of the black community. I have also seen that we are coming back together.
